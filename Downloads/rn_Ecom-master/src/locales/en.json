The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. – See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf\n\nAccording to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:\n\nUsers can visit our site anonymously.Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.Our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’ and can easily be found on the page specified above.You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:\n\n• Via EmailCan change your personal information:\n\n• By logging in to your account\n\nHow does our site handle Do Not Track signals?\n\nWe honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.\n\nDoes our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?\n\nIt’s also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral tracking\n\nCOPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)\n\nWhen it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.\n\nWe do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.\n\nFair Information Practice\n\nThe Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.\n\nIn order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:\n\nWe will notify you via email\n\n• Within 7 business days\n\nWe also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.\n\nCAN SPAM Act\n\nThe CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.\n\nWe collect your email address in order to:\n\n• Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions\n\n• Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.\n\n• Send you additional information related to your product and/or service\n\n• Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred.\n\nTo be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:\n\n• Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.\n\n• Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.\n\n• Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.\n\n• Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.\n\n• Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.\n\n• Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.\n\nIf at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at support@dealsgala.com\n\n• Follow the instructions at the bottom of each email and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.\n\nDealsGala rights\n\nDealsGala has the right to cancel/modify orders, store and save customer’s information, remove and ban a customer and discontinue a service at anytime.\n\nContacting Us\n\nIf there are any questions regarding this privacy policy, you may contact us using the information below.\n\nsupport@dealsgala.com",
